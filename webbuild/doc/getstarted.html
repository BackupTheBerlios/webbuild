<h1>Getting started with WebBuild</h1>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>Please not that you need a Cygwin environment on Microsoft Windows Systems, otherwise WebBuild does not
   work. On UNIX-based operating systems it should run native if you have installed the following tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Streaming Editor sed</li>
  <li>GNU AWK</li>
  <li>GNU make</li>
</ul>  
<h2>Hint</h2> 
<p>If you want to use WebBuild properly you have to keep to some rules concerning the internal file structure
   of your Web project. In this example we assume that you have a project called "foobar" that is 
   located under <i>/home/itsme/web/foobar</i>.</p>
<h2>Extracting Package</h2>
<p>You have downloaded the ZIP file from our server. Now put it to your projects directory, e.g. <i>/home/itsme/web/foobar</i>
   and extract it with your common decompression program.</p>
<p>Now there is a new folder created, named webbuild. This folder has two sub-folders system and doc. The folder doc
   contains some HTML files with further information and helpful instructions how to handle WebBuild.</p>
<p>System is the more important folder. This is the one which contains the main files which will build your pages
   later on. You have to copy Makefile and <i>Makefile.rules</i> to the root directory of your project. Currently the structure
   of your project should look like this:</p>
<p class="cmd">   
   /home/itsme/web/foobar<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;|-webbuild<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;+--system<br>
   Makefile<br>
   Makefile.rules<br>
</p>    
<h2>Creating Source Directory </h2>
<p>The source directory (src) is the one which inherits the files with the content you want to build HTML pages from.
   These files contain your defined patterns and the text or images you want to place into your template file.</p>
<p>You should create the source directory named src directly under your root directory.</p>
<h2>Creating Template File</h2>
<p>Using WebBuild requires a template file. This file is written in HTML code and contains the pattern that you want to
   replace with the content from the source directory. You have to place the template under the root directory.</p>
<p>These tags look like <span class="tag">&lt;hive field="tag-name" /&gt;</span>. Replace "tag-name" with a qualified name 
containing letters and numbers.</p>   
<p>Now your projects directory should look like this:</p>
<p class="cmd">   
   /home/itsme/web/foobar<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;|-src<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;|-webbuild<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;+--system<br>
   Makefile<br>
   Makefile.rules<br>
   template.html<br>
</p> 
<h2>Creating Source File</h2>
<p>As mentioned before you have to create a source file that contains the content you want to replace in the
   HTML template. Your name the source file like the HTML file you want to create but instead you use the ending
   *.src, e.g. index.html will be index.src.</p>
<p>The content should look like this 
   <span class="tag">&lt;hive field="tag-name"&gt;</span>My content, I want to replace<span class="tag">&lt;/hive&gt;
   </span>. 
   Save your file under the former created directory src.</p>
<h2>Configuring the Make-System</h2>
<p>Before you can build a HTML page you have to open and edit <i>Makefile.rules</i>. <i>Makefile.rules</i> contains two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ROOT</li>
  <li>ADDON</li>
</ul> 
<p>You have to set ROOT with the global file path to your project, e.g. <i>/home/itsme/web/foobar</i>.</p>  
<p>You have to set ADDON with the name of the WebBuild directory with the additional files. If you did not rename
   the directory you can leave the name unchanged.</p> 
<h2>Executing Make-System</h2>
<p>See commands.html with a list of commands you can use. There are also additional information and tips.</p>
